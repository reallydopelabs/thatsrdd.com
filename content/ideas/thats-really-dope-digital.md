## Our Process

We customize our approach based on each project and business. In order to establish a streamlined experience, however, we have a broadly defined process that allows us to deliver expectations upfront while still providing a dynamic, hands-on and collaborative approach to our work.

We've spent years refining the way we work with our partners to simplify the process and maximize results. Our simple, three-step process to collaboration and execution applies to all of our services, ensuring strong and transparent partnerships.

### Discover

We work with you to nail down branding, voice, and creative direction prior to scoping out development of the project. This ensures the full creative vision is laid out and all costs are understood.

### Execute

Once all the requirements and costs are identified, we scope out the project and execute on our collaborative discovery. This is where we bring your idea to life.

### Refine

We believe that a good product is never finished. True creativity is a constant refinement. We know how to analyze digital products in the wild and use that data to help you continuously move the line forward.

## Cross-discipline Portfolio

We specialize in two segments of digital production: **Content Platforms** and **Digital Marketing**. We then offer complimentary services in each of these segments including branding, media, migrations, consulting and more.

### Content Platforms

Content creators aiming to future-proof their work and find new ways to monetize their audiences should be shifting to platforms that they themselves own and control. We have written about the critical nature of this in our article _[The Importance of Owning Your Platform As An Online Creator](/ideas/the-importance-of-owning-your-platform-as-an-online-creator)_.

In subscription-based creator models, Monthly Recurring Revenue, or MRR, is the key performance indicator. The goal of modern creators should be to establish a baseline MRR off of their audience and find ways to steadily increase this month over month while occasionally marketing additional add-ons or products to that audience.

We are experts in utilizing the best platforms on the internet that put full ownership into the hands of brands and creators while maximizing MRR. Our main platform is [Ghost](https://ghost.org), a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters and offer paid subscriptions to members. We consider ourselves to be the leading Ghost experts in the world.

After migrating the global Art & Science publication Quillette from WordPress to Ghost, we enabled them to go from around $12,000 MRR in donations to $30,000 MRR off of subscriptions. They are providing more value than ever to their readers while operating a seven-figure business off a platform that costs them $0 outside of the cost of hosting the site. According to Ghost’s public database, Quillette is now the **[third largest publication on Ghost based on revenue](https://ghost.org/explore/)**.

_MXSR_ (Mag X (by) Sam Rapaport) is an online design and development magazine focused on fashion and creative software. We designed the branding from the ground up, launched the publication on Ghost, built a custom theme to fit the branding, and continue to provide creative direction for the magazine’s major editorials as they are published. This project is a perfect example of our ability to execute on platform development while delivering complimentary services in branding and design.

### Digital Marketing

Service and product-driven businesses look to Really Dope Digital to design and develop cutting-edge web experiences while providing complimentary branding and media services to elevate their presence online. We are website experts, having produced massive marketing sites such as [Virgin Orbit](https://virginorbit.com) and spent nearly a decade working with the latest code standards and frameworks. We have seen trends come and go. We know what’s in, what’s out, what’s a fad and what’s here to stay. Not only that, we have the development and engineering skills to build the most custom experiences from award-winning front end websites to complex web applications.

Our work with [Etho](/projects/etho), [Vexus](/projects/vexus), [City of Angeles Flea](/projects/city-of-angels-flea), and [Yitsach](/projects/yitsach) are just a few examples of our creative abilities in web development and general branding.
