As content creators, it can be frustrating to be at the mercy of centralized platforms that host our work. We may not have control over how our content is used or shared, and we may be subjected to the terms and conditions of these platforms, which can change at any time. Additionally, it can be difficult to monetize our content on these platforms due to limited options for earning revenue. There is also always the risk of censorship on these platforms. It may be time to consider decentralization or, more broadly, "platform ownership" as an alternative for hosting and sharing our content.

## Why take ownership?
As a content creator, owning your own platform can be important for a number of reasons.

### Control
When you own your own platform, you have complete control over how your content is presented, how it is shared, and who has access to it. You are not at the mercy of the policies and terms of service of a centralized platform, which can change at any time.

The idea of "deplatforming", once reserved for religious extremists or hardcore conspiracy theorists, is an ever-increasing threat to even the most factual and reasonable voices of content creators on centralized platforms like Twitter. We've seen just how opaque and intentionally one-sided these policies can go, most recently with The Twitter Files.

### Monetization
Owning your own platform can also give you more control over how you monetize your content. You may have more flexibility to choose the types of ads that are displayed, or to offer premium content on a subscription basis.

At Really Dope Digital, we've launched dozens of creators on [Ghost](https://ghost.org), a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid subscriptions to members. We know the platform inside and out, from launching day-one publications to building custom themes and managing high-traffic infrastructure for massive publications, like [Quillette](/projects/quillette).

### Audience Engagement
By owning your own platform, you can build a closer relationship with your audience. You can use your platform to communicate directly with your audience, gather feedback, and build a sense of community.

### Long-term stability
Owning your own platform can also provide long-term stability for your content. Centralized platforms can experience technical issues, change their policies, or shut down, which can result in your content being lost or removed. By owning your own platform, you can ensure that your content is always available to your audience.

## Choosing the right platform
Ghost is one of the best options for content creators looking to host their own platform. It is an open-source content management system that is focused on simplicity and ease of use, making it ideal for bloggers, writers, and other content creators.

One of the main benefits of Ghost is that it allows you to fully own and control your content. You are not subject to the terms and conditions of a centralized platform, and you have complete control over how your content is presented and shared. This is especially important for creators who want to express controversial or unpopular views, as there is no risk of censorship on a self-hosted platform.

Perhaps most importantly, it has support for paid memberships with 0% fees baked right in. You can start charging for your content immediately and take home 100% of the revenue from your audience, while maintaining complete control over the content and data.

In addition to control, ownership, and monetization, Ghost also offers a range of features that make it easy to create and manage your content. The platform has a clean and intuitive interface, and it comes with a variety of customizable templates and design options. It also integrates with a range of third-party tools, such as email marketing services and social media platforms, which makes it easy to promote and monetize your content. Overall, Ghost is a powerful and flexible platform that is ideal for content creators looking to take control of their online presence.

## Going independent
At Really Dope Digital, we specialize in launching or relaunching content creators onto Ghost. We've done it successfully for both day-one creators and publications already doing multiple five figures in MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue).

If you're serious about making the switch, [get in touch with our team at RDD](/contact) and we can talk you through the process. If you're curious, here are a few of the things we help you figure out when moving your audience from a centralized platform like Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube, to a decentralized one like Ghost:

1. Communicate with your audience: Let your audience know about your plans to move to a decentralized platform and explain the benefits. Be sure to communicate regularly with your audience during the transition process to keep them informed and engaged.
2. Export your content: Many centralized platforms allow you to export your content, so you can easily move it to a decentralized platform. Be sure to take advantage of this feature to make the transition as seamless as possible for your audience.
3. Set the stage: Make sure that your new platform is up-to-par with your brand guidelines and provides an excellent user experience. The site should load quick, be mobile responsive, and easy to navigate for your users. It should be built properly from the beginning, laying the foundation for future growth. This is the equivalent of moving from a vendor booth at trade shows to your own storefront or office.
4. Redirect your audience: If you have a significant following on a centralized platform, you can use that platform to redirect your audience to your new decentralized platform. You can do this by posting updates or creating a redirect link in your profile or bio.
5. Promote your new platform: Once you have moved to a decentralized platform, be sure to promote it to your audience and encourage them to follow you on your new platform. You can use your social media accounts, email list, or other channels to spread the word about your new home.
6. Engage with your audience: Finally, be sure to engage with your audience on your new decentralized platform. Respond to comments, ask for feedback, and create content that resonates with your audience to keep them engaged and coming back for more.
